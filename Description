This application that will be used to manage the logistics of a seaport in terms of a
transhipment terminal for container ships. The application will be used to unload and load containers from/to the ship. In case of unloading, the containers can be transferred to the warehouse
or directly to the railway transport carriage.
Each ship has a different capacity and deadweight defined by:
• the maximum number of containers with toxic or explosive cargo that can be loaded within
the ship
• the maximum number of heavy containers
• the maximum number of containers requiring connection to the electricity network
• the maximum number of all containers
• the maximum weight load
Each ship stores basic information about itself (unique identification number assigned automatically when creating the object, name, home port, transport origin and destination).
In the case of load capacity of containers for toxic and explosive cargo - this value is common
for both types of containers. E.g. if the ship has three places for containers with explosive or
toxic cargo, these places can be loaded respectively by:
• 3 containers with explosive cargo
• 2 containers with explosive cargo and 1 container with toxic cargo
• 1 containers with explosive cargo and 2 container with toxic cargo
• 3 container with toxic cargo
Each type of container has a different set of attributes (e.g. information about the sender,
tare, information about the security of the container, net weight, gross weight, information about
certificates, etc.). Also, each container has its own unique identification number assigned automatically when creating the object. For each type of container, you must additionally devise at
least one unique attribute throughout all container types.
We have at our disposal, among others:
• standard container,
• heavy container, which is a type of standard container,
• a refrigerated container, which is a type of heavy container, requiring connection to the
ship’s electrical network,
• a container for liquids cargo, which is a type of standard container,
• a container for explosives cargo, which is a type of standard container,
• a container for toxic cargo, which is a type of heavy container, which is available in two
versions: a container for toxic powdery cargo and a container for toxic liquid cargo, which
is not only a kind of heavy container, but also has the features of a container for liquids
cargo.
